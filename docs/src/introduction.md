# Introduction 

Cell free biology is an emerging technology for research, and the point of care manufacturing of a wide array of macromolecular and small molecule products. A distinctive feature of cell free systems is the absence of cellular growth and maintenance, thereby allowing the direct allocation of carbon and energy resources toward a product of interest. Moreover, cell free systems are more amenable than living systems to observation and manipulation, hence allowing rapid tuning of reaction conditions. Recent advances in cell free extract preparation and energy regeneration mechanisms have increased the versatility and range of applications that can be produced cell free.
Thus, the cell free platform has transformed from merely an investigative research tool to become a promising alternative to traditionally used living systems for biomanufacturing as well as biological research. In combination with the rise of synthetic biology, cell free systems today have not only taken on a new role as a promising technology for just in time manufacturing of therapeutically important biologics and high-value small molecules,
but have also been utilized for applications such as biosensing, prototyping genetic parts, and metabolic engineering.
